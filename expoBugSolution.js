The solution involves careful version management.  First, ensure your Expo CLI is up-to-date using `expo upgrade`. Then, double-check the versions of your native modules listed in your `package.json`. Make sure these versions are compatible with the Expo SDK version you're using. You might need to downgrade or upgrade some modules to resolve dependency conflicts.  If you're using EAS Build, carefully review the EAS Build logs for specific error messages to identify problematic native modules. Cleaning your project's cache (`expo prebuild --clean`) and reinstalling packages (`expo install`) can also sometimes resolve minor discrepancies.  In complex cases, consider creating a minimal reproducible example to isolate the issue and pinpoint the specific native module causing the problem.
